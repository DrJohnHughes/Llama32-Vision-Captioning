The sky appears blue to our eyes because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Sunlight composition**: Sunlight is made up of a spectrum of colors, including all the colors of the rainbow. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it contains all these colors.

2. **Scattering**: As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions. However, they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.

3. **Blue light dominance**: Because the shorter wavelengths of blue light are scattered more than the longer wavelengths of red light, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere. This is why the sky typically appears blue, especially during the daytime when the sun is overhead.

4. **Atmospheric conditions**: The appearance of the sky can change depending on atmospheric conditions. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink because the sunlight has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach our eyes, scattering the shorter wavelengths of blue and green light.

5. **Atmospheric pollution and dust**: In some cases, pollution and dust particles in the atmosphere can scatter light in a way that makes the sky appear hazy or gray, rather than blue.

So, to summarize, the sky appears blue because of the way that the tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight, favoring the shorter wavelengths of blue light.
